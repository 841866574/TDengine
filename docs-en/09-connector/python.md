title: TDengine Python Connector
---


`taospy` is the official Python connector for TDengine. `taospy` provides a rich set of APIs that makes it easy for Python applications to access TDengine. `taospy` wraps both the [native interface](/reference/connector/cpp) and [REST interface](/reference/rest-api) of TDengine, which correspond to the `taos` and `taosrest` modules of the `taospy` package, respectively. But for cloud users using `taosrest` is enough.
In addition to wrapping the native and REST interfaces, `taospy` also provides a set of programming interfaces that conforms to the [Python Data Access Specification (PEP 249)](https://peps.python.org/pep-0249/). It is easy to integrate `taospy` with many third-party tools, such as [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

The source code for the Python connector is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/taosdata/taos-connector-python).

## Installation

### Preparation

1. Install Python. Python >= 3.6 is recommended. If Python is not available on your system, refer to the [Python BeginnersGuide](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) to install it.
2. Install [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/). In most cases, the Python installer comes with the pip utility. If not, please refer to [pip documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) to install it.

### Install via pip

```
pip3 install taospy>=2.3.3
```

### Installation verification

Verifying that the `taosrest` module can be imported successfully. This can be done in the Python Interactive Shell by typing.

```python
import taosrest
```

## Establish connection

```python
{{#include docs-examples/python/connect_cloud_example.py:connect}}
```

All arguments to the `connect()` function are optional keyword arguments. The following are the connection parameters specified.

- `url`ï¼š The cloud URL.
- `token`: The cloud token.
- `timeout`: HTTP request timeout in seconds. The default is `socket._GLOBAL_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`. Usually, no configuration is needed.

## Sample program

### Use of TaosRestCursor class

The ``TaosRestCursor`` class is an implementation of the PEP249 Cursor interface.

```python title="Use of TaosRestCursor"
{{#include docs-examples/python/connect_cloud_example.py:basic}}
```
- `cursor.execute` : Used to execute arbitrary SQL statements.
- `cursor.rowcount` : For write operations, returns the number of successful rows written. For query operations, returns the number of rows in the result set.
- `cursor.description` : Returns the description of the field. Please refer to [TaosRestCursor](https://docs.taosdata.com/api/taospy/taosrest/cursor.html) for the specific format of the description information.

### Use of the RestClient class

The `RestClient` class is a direct wrapper for the [REST API](/reference/rest-api). It contains only a `sql()` method for executing arbitrary SQL statements and returning the result.

```python title="Use of RestClient"
{{#include docs-examples/python/rest_client_cloud_example.py}}
```

For a more detailed description of the `sql()` method, please refer to [RestClient](https://docs.taosdata.com/api/taospy/taosrest/restclient.html).
