title: Third Party Tools
---

TDengine's support for standard SQL commands, common database connector standards (e.g., JDBC), ORM, and other popular time-series database writing protocols (e.g., InfluxDB Line Protocol, OpenTSDB JSON, OpenTSDB Telnet, etc.) makes TDengine very easy to use with third-party tools.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
